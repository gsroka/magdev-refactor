### 🛡️ Type Safety & Code Quality

* [x] **Modernization of Build Tooling & Static Analysis Configuration**
* **Issue:** The repository relied on outdated `package.json` dependencies and lacked strict, standardized configurations for linting and formatting.
* **Why:** Inconsistent development environments increase technical debt, allow solvable bugs to merge, and slow down onboarding. Legacy build configurations can also introduce security vulnerabilities.
* **Fix:** Updated core dependencies to stable versions, implemented strict `ESLint` and `Prettier` rulesets for consistency, and refactored `vite.config.ts` to align with current ecosystem standards.
* **Trade-offs:** Stricter linting rules may require a significant initial investment to fix existing violations across the legacy codebase.
